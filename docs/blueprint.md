# **App Name**: PIP Validator

## Core Features:

- Polygon Drawing Map: Display a Google Map for drawing a polygon. Uses the drawing library to capture the polygon's coordinates.
- Point Selection Map: Display a separate Google Map where the user can click to select a point.
- Coordinate Display: Display the latitude and longitude of the clicked point.
- Point in Polygon Function: Implement a function that takes the polygon coordinates and the point coordinates as input, then determines whether the point lies within the polygon.
- PIP Result Display: Display the result of the point-in-polygon calculation (inside or outside) in a visible location of the webpage.
- Code Export: Provide an option to export the point in polygon function for use in other projects.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#3F51B5) for a professional and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F5F5F5). Keeps the attention on the map interaction.
- Accent color: Light orange (#FF9800) for highlighting the point-in-polygon result.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clear and simple icons from Google's Material Design icon set to indicate actions.
- Divide the page into two main sections: one for the polygon drawing map and another for the point selection map, with the result displayed prominently between them.
